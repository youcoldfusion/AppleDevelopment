Swift Testing
Swift Testing is a new framework with expressive and intuitive APIs that make testing your Swift code a breeze.
Clear, expressive API
Swift Testing has a clear and expressive API built using macros, so you can declare complex behaviors with a small amount of code. 
The #expect API uses Swift expressions and operators, and captures the evaluated values so you can quickly understand what went wrong
when a test fails. Parameterized tests help you run the same test over a sequence of values so you can write less code. And all tests 
integrate seamlessly with Swift Concurrency and run in parallel by default.
