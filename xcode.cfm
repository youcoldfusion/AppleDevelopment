Xcode enables you to develop, test, and distribute apps for all Apple platforms.   
Code and design your apps faster with predictive code completion, 
interactive previews, and live animations. Use Git staging to craft 
your next commit without leaving your code. Explore and diagnose your 
test results with redesigned test reports with video recording. 
And start deploying seamlessly to TestFlight and the App Store from Xcode Cloud. 
Creating amazing apps has never been easier.

Xcode is available on the Mac App Store, with downloadable simulator 
runtimes for all platforms. Predictive code completion helps you write
safer code faster, with an on-device machine learning model trained 
for Swift and Apple SDKs. And projects build faster thanks to improvements 
in the compiler and a linker, 
optimized for the multicore architecture of Apple silicon.
